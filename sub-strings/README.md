# Project: Sub Strings

This is a Ruby method that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

### Parameters

(String, Array)

### Returns

Hash

## Challenges

- Make sure the method can handle multiple words.
- Recall how to turn strings into arrays and arrays into strings.
